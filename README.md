# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About the app

A simple react app that lets you enter your city name, population, homelessness %, average family size and the average cost to build oe home. It then computes the total cost to eradicate homelessness from your city.

# Note:

The cost is based on the inputs you provide which don't have to be exactly accurate figures, thus you can say that this computed total cost is a tentavive figure. 

You can download the cost as an image (I tried to implement the image download functionality in react, it may or may not work on every device, apologies for that inadvance :) )
